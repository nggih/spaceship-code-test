# Coding Assignment

## 1. Overview

You are asked to design, build, and deploy an AI-powered analytics dashboard for a logistics client.

This assignment evaluates your ability to:

- Build a full-stack application
- Work with structured data
- Design meaningful analytics
- Integrate AI responsibly
- Implement forecasting
- Deploy a production-ready system
- Communicate technical decisions clearly

## 2. Project Summary

Build a web application that allows users to explore logistics data through:

- A traditional analytics dashboard (KPIs and charts)
- A natural-language interface powered by AI

The system should support:

- Querying operational data
- Generating charts dynamically
- Answering business questions
- Predicting demand

## 3. Core Concept

The application must use one unified dataset and support three levels of intelligence:

### 3.1 Descriptive Analytics

- Dashboards and visualizations

### 3.2 Diagnostic Analytics

- Natural-language queries answered from data

### 3.3 Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics

- Forecasting demand

## 4. Core Requirements

### 4.1 Dashboard

Create a dashboard for a logistics client.

#### Minimum KPIs

- Total orders
- Delivered orders
- Delayed orders
- On-time delivery rate
- Average delivery time

#### Minimum Charts (at least 2)

- Order volume over time
- Delivery performance (delayed vs. on-time)
- Carrier or destination breakdown

### 4.2 Natural Language Queries

Users must be able to ask questions such as:

- "Show delayed orders by week for the last 3 months"
- "Which carrier has the highest delay rate?"
- "How many orders were delivered late last month?"

The system should:

1. Interpret the question
2. Retrieve relevant data
3. Return:
   - A direct answer
   - A chart
   - Or both

### 4.3 Dynamic Chart Generation

The system must:

- Automatically select an appropriate chart type
- Render charts dynamically
- Support a subset of analytical queries

### 4.4 Explainability

For every answer or chart, include:

- Filters used (for example, time range)
- Metrics and dimensions
- Query plan or structured interpretation (recommended)
- Access to underlying data (table or summary)

### 4.5 Data Handling

- Use the provided dataset or database
- Treat all data as read-only
- Ensure correct aggregation and filtering

## 5. AI-Orchestrated Analytical Tools

The AI layer must act as a routing and orchestration system, not as the source of truth.

### Key Principle

AI should:

- Interpret the user's question
- Select the correct computation path
- Call the appropriate tool
- Present results clearly

AI must **not** generate answers without computation.

### 5.1 Required Analytical Tools

#### A. Query Tool (Analytics)

Used for:

- Dashboard queries
- Aggregations
- KPI calculations

Examples:

- "Show delayed orders by week"
- "Which carrier has the highest delay rate?"

#### B. Forecasting Tool

Used for:

- Predicting future demand

Examples:

- "Predict demand for SKU X for the next 4 months"
- "How much inventory should I plan?"

Requirements:

- Use historical dataset data
- Apply a basic forecasting method
- Return:
  - Forecast values
  - Visualization (historical and forecast)
  - Inventory recommendation
  - Explanation of methodology

Acceptable methods:

- Moving average
- Linear regression
- Exponential smoothing
- Simple trend models

### 5.2 Expected System Flow

```text
User Question
    → AI Interpretation
    → Tool Selection
    → Structured Input
    → Computation
    → Result
    → Explanation
    → Visualization
```

## 6. Deployment Requirements

Your application must:

- Be deployed to a publicly accessible URL
- Be fully usable without local setup
- Be stable and functional for reviewers

If authentication is used:

- Provide test credentials

Notes:

- You may use any platform (for example, Vercel or AWS)
- Do **not** commit secrets to the repository

## 8. Technical Expectations

You may use any technology stack.

Examples (optional):

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, or Vue
- **Backend:** Node, Python, Java, or .NET
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## 9. Architecture Guidelines

- Avoid executing raw AI-generated SQL without validation
- Prefer structured query generation
- Clearly separate:
  - AI interpretation
  - Data computation
  - Business logic

## 10. Deliverables

You must submit:

- Source code repository
- Live deployed application URL
- `README.md`

## 11. README Requirements

Your README must include:

### Setup

- Local setup instructions
- Environment variables

### Architecture

- System overview
- Key design decisions
- Data flow

### AI Approach

- How questions are interpreted
- How tools are selected

### Assumptions

- Simplifications made

### Limitations

- Unsupported features or queries

### Future Improvements

- What you would build next

## 12. Time Expectation

Expected effort: **6–10 hours**

We value:

- Clarity
- Correctness
- Reasoning

Over:

- Completeness
- Polish

## 13. Evaluation Criteria

| Category | Weight |
|---|---:|
| Product & UX | 15% |
| Frontend | 15% |
| Backend & Architecture | 20% |
| Data Correctness | 20% |
| AI Orchestration | 15% |
| Forecasting | 10% |
| Deployment | 5% |

## 14. Bonus (Optional)

- Query history
- Caching
- Tests
- Docker setup
- Advanced explainability
- Handling ambiguous queries

## 15. Important Notes

- Do **not** over-engineer
- Prefer simple, correct solutions
- Clearly explain tradeoffs
- Undisclosed AI usage may be treated negatively

## 16. Submission

Provide:

- Repository link
- Deployed app URL
- Credentials (if required)

## 17. What We're Evaluating
